# Qode

Qode is a lightly modified fork of Node.js that merges Node's event loop with Qt's event loop.
It is designed to be used together with `@nodegui/nodegui`.

Qode runs both Qt and Node's event loops in the same thread. This is crucial to achieving low CPU footprint.
Qode can be used as a _drop in_ replacement of NodeJS and hence you could consider it as NodeJS with Qt powers ðŸ’ª.

This npm module downloads the prebuilt qode for the current Operating System.
